Hi {{FirstName}},

As we transition from the cold, wet days of winter to the warm, humid days of spring, your dog's grooming needs are changing too — and staying ahead of those changes can make a world of difference.

## Why Seasonal Grooming Matters

When the weather shifts from **cold and wet** to **warm and humid**, your dog's coat and skin face new challenges:

### Winter to Spring Transition Challenges

**Cold & Wet Weather:**
* Thicker coats trap moisture, leading to matting and skin irritation
* Damp fur can harbor bacteria and cause hot spots
* Reduced air circulation under dense winter coats

**Warm & Humid Weather:**
* Increased shedding as dogs lose their winter undercoat
* Higher risk of overheating with a heavy coat
* More prone to skin infections in humid conditions
* Matting becomes more problematic as fur gets wet from spring showers

## The Benefits of Spring Grooming

Getting your dog groomed as the seasons change helps:

**🌱 Remove Winter Coat**
A professional groom removes the dense winter undercoat, allowing your dog's skin to breathe and preventing matting.

**🌡️ Temperature Regulation**
A properly groomed coat helps your dog stay cool as temperatures rise, reducing the risk of overheating.

**💧 Skin Health**
Removing dead hair and mats prevents moisture buildup that can lead to skin infections and hot spots.

**🌿 Fresh Start**
A spring groom removes accumulated dirt, debris, and odors from winter, giving your dog a clean slate for the warmer months ahead.

**😊 Comfort & Wellbeing**
A well-groomed dog is more comfortable, less itchy, and happier overall — which means fewer vet visits and more quality time together.

## When to Schedule

The best time to schedule your spring grooming is **before the humidity really sets in** — typically late February through early April. This gives your dog's coat time to adjust and prevents the discomfort that comes with a heavy coat in warm weather.

At Jameson & Company, we understand how seasonal changes affect your dog's needs. Our groomers are trained to help your dog transition smoothly from winter to spring, ensuring they're comfortable and healthy as the weather warms up.

Don't wait until your dog is uncomfortable — schedule your spring grooming appointment today and give them the fresh start they deserve.

Warmly,  
**Jameson & Company Dog Grooming**
