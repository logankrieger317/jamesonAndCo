**Subject:** A Small Change That Makes Booking Much Easier

**Campaign Type:** System Update Announcement

**Target Audience:** All existing customers

---

Hello,

We're excited to share a small change that makes booking your dog's groom **much easier**.

Starting soon, Jameson & Company will be moving from a *hair length–based* booking system to a **breed + weight pricing system**.

## Why the change?

Because we heard you.

We know it can be frustrating to:

* Guess whether your dog is "short," "medium," or "long" hair
* Wonder why certain services don't show up after selecting hair length
* Feel unsure which service is actually best for your dog's coat and needs

With the new system, you simply choose your dog's **breed and weight**, and we'll take it from there.

From that information, our booking system will:

* Recommend the **most ideal services** for your dog's coat type
* Automatically show services that make sense for your breed
* Remove the guesswork (and the second-guessing)

No more wondering, *"Did I pick the right option?"*  
No more *"Why can't I see that service?"*

It's simpler, clearer, and helps us prepare the right care for your dog before they even arrive.

As always, if you ever have questions or need help booking, we're happy to help — just reach out.

Thank you for trusting us with your pups. We're always looking for ways to make your experience smoother and more straightforward.

Warmly,  
**Jameson & Company Dog Grooming**
