Hi {{FirstName}},

February is all about love — and for us, that means caring for dogs in ways that go beyond grooming day.

What many people don't realize is that a dog's **coat health, skin comfort, and even mood** are influenced by what's happening *inside* their body, not just what we see on the outside.

Here are a few **dog-safe, vet-approved human foods** that can help support healthier skin, shinier coats, and overall comfort when given in moderation:

## 🥕 Carrots
Great for skin health and gentle crunching. They're low-calorie and can help support coat condition.

## 🫐 Blueberries
Packed with antioxidants that support overall wellness and can help reduce inflammation.

## 🥚 Eggs (fully cooked)
A fantastic source of protein and biotin — both important for healthy skin and coat growth.

## 🐟 Plain cooked salmon
Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce itching and support a soft, healthy coat. (No seasoning or oils.)

## 🥒 Cucumbers
Hydrating, refreshing, and gentle on the stomach — especially helpful during dry winter months.

A quick reminder: treats and add-ins should always be given in small amounts, and it's best to introduce new foods slowly. If your dog has allergies or sensitivities, checking with your vet is always a good idea.

At Jameson & Company, we see firsthand how nutrition, coat care, and grooming all work together. A well-cared-for dog is not only more comfortable — they're happier, calmer, and healthier overall.

This month, give your dog a little extra love in the ways that matter most.  
We'll take care of the grooming — you handle the cuddles.

Warmly,  
**Jameson & Company Dog Grooming**
