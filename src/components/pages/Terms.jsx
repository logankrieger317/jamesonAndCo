                <p>
                  The following terms govern the July Freedom Special Promotion and apply in addition to all general promotional and referral terms issued by Jameson & Company Dog Grooming.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Eligibility to Refer</b><br/>
                  Only past or current paying clients of Jameson & Company Dog Grooming may refer new customers for this promotion. Referrals from individuals who have not previously booked a paid service will not be accepted.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Referral Submission Requirements</b><br/>
                  The referring client's name must be entered into the designated referral field at the time the new client books their appointment. Verbal referrals, social media tags, or referrals made after the booking is submitted will not qualify for this promotion.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Referral Discount Timeline</b><br/>
                  Referred clients must complete a grooming service during the months of July, August, or September 2025 for the referral to qualify. Referrals that result in appointments scheduled outside this 3-month period are not eligible for a discount.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Discount Details for Referring Clients</b><br/>
                  Referring clients will receive a 10% discount on a single future appointment once their referral has been verified and the referred service completed. This discount is valid for services booked and completed by December 31, 2025.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Discount "Banking" for Multiple Referrals</b><br/>
                  Clients may make multiple referrals. Each valid referral will result in one banked 10% discount. However, only one discount may be applied per appointment. Banked discounts must be redeemed individually and are not combinable. All banked referral discounts must be used before December 31, 2025.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Service Booking Discount (for All Clients)</b><br/>
                  Any client who books and completes a grooming service during July 2025, or books in July for an appointment occurring in July, August, or September 2025, will automatically receive 10% off that service.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Military, Veteran, and First Responder Discount</b><br/>
                  Military personnel, veterans, and first responders are eligible for an automatic 10% discount on any service booked and completed during the promotion period (July–September 2025) with valid identification.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Enhanced Referral Discount for Military/Veterans/First Responders</b><br/>
                  If a qualifying military, veteran, or first responder refers a new client who completes a service in July, August, or September 2025, the referring party will be eligible for a one-time 20% discount on a future appointment. This discount may not be stacked with any other offer and must be used by December 31, 2025.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Limitations and Stacking of Discounts</b><br/>
                  Only one discount or promotional offer may be applied per appointment unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing. Discounts cannot be combined or transferred and have no cash value.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Verification and Processing Time</b><br/>
                  Referral and discount eligibility verification may take 7–10 business days. Services booked during this verification window may not reflect discount credits immediately. Jameson & Company Dog Grooming reserves the right to request proof of eligibility, including but not limited to photo ID, email confirmation, or service history.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Promotion Expiration and Final Authority</b><br/>
                  All promotional discounts must be claimed and used by December 31, 2025. Jameson & Company Dog Grooming reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, suspend, or terminate the promotion at any time for any reason. All decisions regarding eligibility, discount application, or dispute resolution are final.<br/><br/>

                  <b>Referral Eligibility</b><br/>
